## Description of project :compass:

We will build a marketplace to allow the client (buyers) and sellers sell and buy product in a easy and safe way.

###### As a seller : 
 * I can register, login, and logout
 * I can add and modify products for sale and track sales of these products **(You should also be able to delete the products.)**
 * I can create and modify my store profile
 * I can view product purchases and mark them as shipped while adding tracking information
 * I can view client service requests on sales and respond
 * I can search the product catalog **(Same as user)**
 * I can see if my products are overprice compared to other sellers **(How will you accomplish this?)**
 
 ###### As a User :
 * I can register, login, and logout
 * I can see product detail
 * I can ask for a refund
 * I can write reviews and rate the product **(That you previously purchased?)**
 * I can see the review of people about the product **(I can see product reviews)**
 * I can see ~~similair product~~ **products similar** to the searched product
 * I can add/delete/modify quantities for products to my shopping cart
 * I can compare prices to other sellers **(Same as for Seller)**
 * I can see if the price was dropped or if the product is on sale **(How is this done?)**
